#Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to gather information of best 1000 computer Science researchers from [this website] https://research.com/scientists-rankings/best-scientists/us?page={page_id}%22
Later we used the scraped data to understand the following demographics and correlations using Tableau dashboard:
1. Scientists and the average publication in European countries
2. Average citations in each university in Asia
3. Average Citation per country
4. Which column is directly correlated to World Rank.
